# Hugo Future Imperfect

Future Imperfect is a responsive theme tailored for blogging. The name is of no
coincidence, because it is a port of [HTML5 UP's theme](http://html5up.net/future-imperfect)
by the same name. In addition to the original features, there are more features
that have been added for you to utilize by [jpescador](https://github.com/jpescador), [pacollins](https://github.com/pacollins), [statnmap](https://github.com/statnmap) and [other project contributors](https://github.com/statnmap/hugo-future-imperfect/graphs/contributors)

Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are the integration of a comment-system powered by **Disqus**, **multilingual** support and **language switch**, **syntax highlighting** and **code folding** for source code, **how-to-cite card** and **related articles** sections on bottom of articles, **contact form**.

<!-- /TOC -->

## Getting Started

Run the following commands in your Hugo site directory:

```
mkdir themes
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/statnmap/hugo-future-imperfect.git
```

You will then have access to the theme at _themes/hugo-future-imperfect_ from within
your project folder.

### exampleSite

Within the hugo-future-imperfect folder, there will be a folder in this theme called
_exampleSite_. The structure of the folder will look like this:

```
exampleSite
├── config.toml
├── staticman.yml
├── content
|   ├── about
|   |   └── _index.md
|   ├── blog
|   │   ├── creating-a-new-theme.md
|   │   ├── goisforlovers.md
|   │   ├── hugoisforlovers.md
|   │   └── migrate-from-jekyll.md
|   ├── contact
|   │   └── _index.md
|   └── itemized
|       ├── item1.md
|       ├── item2.md
|       ├── item3.md
|       └── item4.md
├── data
│   └── comments
│       └── .gitkeep
└── static
    ├── css
    │   └── add-on.css
    ├── img
    |   ├── 2014
    |   |   ├── 04
    |   |   |   ├── pic02.jpg
    |   |   |   └── pic03.jpg
    |   |   └── 09
    |   |       └── pic01.jpg
    |   └── main
    |       └── logo.jpg
    └── js
        └── add-on.js
```

Copy _config.toml_ from _exampleSite_ to the root directory of your Hugo site.
If you want static comments hosted by [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), also
copy the _staticman.yml_.

### config.toml

This file is the main sorce of customization within the theme. Each parameter has
a comment included to explain its functionality. Typical usage of _true_ means to
turn a function on, while _false_ means to turn a function off.

This file consists of six main sections. The first section contains the site wide
parameters innate to Hugo. The second section, _[params]_, contains site wide
parameter that are custom to the _hugo-future-imperfect_ theme. The third section,
_[params.staticman]_ controls how staticman comments interact with your repository.
The fourth section, _[params.intro]_ and _[params.postAmount]_, control aspects
of the sidebar. The fifth section, _[[menu.main]]_, sets the navigation menu items.
Lastly, the sixth section, _[social]_, allows you to easily link to, and include,
various social platforms.

### Hugo's Built-In Server

Run the following command to start a local server and to view a live version of
the website:

```
hugo server
```

You will then be able to view your live website at [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

## Shortcodes
In addition to the native [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/),
the theme also includes the following codes that I hope you find useful:
fancybox, img-post, img-fit, and url-link.

### fancybox
[Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) is a jQuery lightbox script for displaying images, videos and more. It is touch
enabled, responsive and fully customizable. The commands are shown below:

**Named**
```
{{< fancybox path="path" file="file" caption="caption" gallery="gallery" >}}
```

**Positional**
```
{{< fancybox "path" "file" "caption" "gallery" >}}
```

Please refer to _layouts/shortcodes/fancybox.html_ for more details on the function.

### img-post
Add an image which can be aligned center, left, or right. The commands are shown
below:

**Named**
```
{{< img-post path="date" file="filename.jpg" alt="Alt Text" type="left" >}}
```

**Positional**
```
{{< img-post "title" "filename.jpg" "Alt Text" "left" >}}
```

Please refer to _layouts/shortcodes/img-post.html_ for more details on the function.

### img-fit
Insert multiple images with the ability to create a gallery if needed. The command
is shown below:

**Positional Only**
```
    {{< img-fit
        "4u" "filename1.jpg" "Alt text 1"
        "4u" "filename2.jpg" "Alt text 2"
        "4u$" "filename3.jpg" "Alt text 3"
        "date" >}}
```

Please refer to _layouts/shortcodes/img-fit.html_ for more details on the function.

### url-link
Create a hyperlink and set a target value for the link. The default value is
`_blank`. The command is shown below:

**Positional Only**
```
{{< url-link "title" "www.link.com" "target">}}
```

Please refer to _layouts/shortcodes/url-link.html_ for more details on the function.

## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting for code is allowed with `highlight.js`. This can be disabled in the `config.toml`. Version, additional languages, CDN and theme can also be modified.

```
    disable_highlight = false
    highlightjsVersion = "9.11.0"
    highlightjsCDN = "//cdn.bootcss.com"
    highlightjsLang = ["r", "yaml"]
    highlightjsTheme = "github"
```

## Multilingual

You don't blog in English and you want to translate the theme into different language? No problem. Take a look in the `i18n` folder and you'll find a file `en.toml` that we've copied at the beginning. It contains all strings related to the theme. Copy this file, change the name so that it reflects the translation language (like `fr.toml`) and modify the strings needed.

A language switcher is also available with multilingual website activated. You can add png images of flags named 'lang.png' in 'static/flags' folder, for new languages other than English and French.

The `config.toml` file in `exampleSite` proposes menus for a second language (French). However, as no posts, itemized or contacts are saved with `.fr.md` extension in this exampleSite, menu items may redirect to the `404 not found` page.

If you only have one language for your website, you can remove every `Languages`, `Languages.en` and `Languages.fr` occurences. Simple `[menu.main]` have to be used instead.

## Code folding

Code folding is enabled by default with `disable_codefolding = false` in parameters of the `config` file. It uses some javascript libraries of [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/). Code folding (multilingual) buttons only appear when there is code in the document rendered from `Rmd` in blogdown. `disable_codefolding` can also be used in each article config header. Similarly, you can define if code blocks are shown or hidden by default using `codefolding_show = "hide"` in the config file or in each article config.  
The list of `<pre>` blocks on which to apply code folding is defined in the `config` file: 
`codeblocks = ["pre.sourceCode", "pre.r", "pre.python"]`

## Citation

As for [Radix](https://rstudio.github.io/radix/), a citation field can be added to blog posts. Citation is enabled by default with `disable_citation = false` in parameters of the `config` file. It can also be enabled or disabled in each blog post with `disable_citation` in the post YAML / TOML. By default author comes from blog `author` field in the article header but `citation_author` overrides this field if another writing is needed. `citation_author` can be specified globally in `config` file but also for each blog post.    
Code is adapted from: Yihan Wu. (2018-12-21). "Blogdown - shortcode for radix-like Bibtex". Retrieved from https://www.yihanwu.ca/post/blogdown-shortcode-generation-for-bibtex/.

## Related articles

You can define parameters for related articles at the bottom of blog posts.

```
[related]
  # Only include matches with rank >= threshold. This is a normalized rank between 0 and 100.
  threshold = 50
  # To get stable "See also" sections we, by default, exclude newer related pages.
  includeNewer = true
  # Will lower case keywords in both queries and in the indexes.
  toLower = true
[[related.indices]]
name = "keywords"
weight = 150
[[related.indices]]
name  = "author"
toLower = true
weight = 30
[[related.indices]]
name  = "tags"
weight = 100
[[related.indices]]
name  = "date"
weight = 10
pattern = "2006"
```
